Proving Lower Bound for Sorting Algorithm:

A decision tree is a full binary tree that represents the comparisons performed using an algorithm between the given inputs

Let x be the number of maximum comparisons performed in a sorting algorithm. The maximum height of the decision tree would then be x

For any sequence number of n numbers, there are n! number of permutation that the sequence can be formed. Therefore, the number of leaves of the full binary tree must be n!

Using height property of a full binary tree:
n! <= 2^x
log(n!) <= x ( log both sides)
Since log(n!) = O(nlogn)
	  x = Omega(nLogn)
